# Retail-Superstore-Analysis
Iâ€™m excited to showcase my recent Power BI project titled â€œRetail Superstore Analysis 
This end-to-end dashboard was built to extract deep insights from retail sales data, focusing on:
ðŸ”¸ hashtag#Customer Behavior:
 Analyzed revenue by age groups, loyalty members, and category preferences.
ðŸ”¸ hashtag#Sales Performance:
 Visualized monthly and yearly sales across product categories and discount levels.
ðŸ”¸ hashtag#Store-Level Insights:
 Compared performance by city and store type (Supermarket vs. Express) with revenue segmentation.
ðŸ”¸ hashtag#Product Trends:
 Tracked sub-category success across regions and revenue types.
ðŸ“Œ Tools Used: Power BI, DAX, Power Query, Data Modeling
 This project strengthened my skills in analytical storytelling, data visualization, and KPI tracking.
Looking forward to more learning and collaboration in the world of data!
